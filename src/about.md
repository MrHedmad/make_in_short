# About

A very short guide to [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

This guide was written to give a quickstart and pointers for using `make`
together with [Kerblam!](https://github.com/MrHedmad/kerblam), but can be
read as a standalone document.

If you are looking for the full GNU make documentation, it can be found
[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/).
It's pretty long.

## Contributing
If you find a typo or you want to change something, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/MrHedmad/make_in_short/issues/new).

## Shorthands and conventions
- *Make* (or *make*) is the GNU Make program, while `make` is the *command* `make`.
- Important notes or prenthetical elements are contained in boxes,
  > Like this.
- Keywords or definitions are ***bold italics***.

## Notes
The `\t` character in code blocs is forcibly rendered as four spaces.
I cannot easily change this, so read the example makefiles with a pinch of salt.
