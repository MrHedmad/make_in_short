# About

A very short guide to [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

This guide was written to give a quickstart and pointers for using `make`
together with [Kerblam!](https://github.com/MrHedmad/kerblam), but can be
read as a standalone document.

If you are looking for the full GNU make documentation, it can be found
[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/).
It's pretty long.
